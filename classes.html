For over 23 years, Palhares was trained directly by the Gracie family—first under Rolls Gracie until his tragic hang gliding accident, and later under Rickson Gracie. Palhares was awarded his black belt in 1984 by Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu co-founders Helio Gracie and Rickson Gracie.
                                    During his lifetime, Palhares has also accumulated a number of world-class competitive victories. In 1998, he won both senior heavyweight and open divisions of the Brazilian National Jiu-Jitsu Championships. Later, in 2000, 2003, and 2004 he, took 1st place at the Pan-American Championship in both the senior heavyweight and open divisions. In 2002, Palhares claimed 3rd place at the Masters and Seniors International Championship.</p>
                                    <p>As an instructor, Palhares has taught throughout the US and Europe. He teaches seminars and conducts private lessons around the globe. He developed a Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Combatives program for the US Navy SEALS at Dam Neck, Virginia, while serving as a certified Army Combatives instructor. In 2010, Palhares taught a five-month-long Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu program for the 3rd Battalion 20th Special Forces Group (Airborne) at Camp Blanding, Florida, prior to their deployment to Afghanistan. He has taught Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu seminars for the US Marines in Tennessee and at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina. Palhares also enjoys a long-standing relationship with the Jacksonville Florida Sheriff's Office (JSO) where he provides instruction. </p>
